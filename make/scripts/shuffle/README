NOTE. This currently only runs on Linux. But the generated scripts
should work on all platforms

1. Set $MAKESHUFFLE_SRCDIR to the directory containing this README
   Also, you can add it to your path

2. cd to the root of a jigsaw forest

3. make (ie. do a build)

4. $MAKESHUFFLE_SRCDIR/makeshufflescripts
   This has only been tested on Linux. Some tweaks to the other
   files in this directory are necssary to run it on a different platform.
   Scripts are written to shufflescripts directory (off root).

5. to shuffle the source: sh shufflescripts/shuffle.sh 
   This puts the shuffled source into a directories called "newsrc"
   under each of the repos.

6. to unshuffle the source: sh shufflescripts/unshuffle.sh
   This copies any changed sources back again


To compare the two source trees run $MAKESHUFFLE_SRCDIR/docompare (from 
the jigsaw root). This creates a file called diffs.txt which is a list
of filenames that are not accounted for in the shuffle. See also the 
beginning of the docompare script for patterns that are not checked
regardless.

There are various files of the form <module>.includes which can be tweaked/
They contain directory names (and file name patterns) of additional files
that belong to each module.

moduleinfo.others

This directory contains moduleinfo from the build output of the
other platforms (other than linux). This contains the names of platform
specific classes (and native code directories) that wouldn't be seen
on the current platform build. If a significant platform specific change
is made (on one of the other platforms) this information may need to be
refreshed.
